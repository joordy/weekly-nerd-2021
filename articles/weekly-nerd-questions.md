# **When are you a good front-end developer?**

<!-- > In the post [What is a good frontend developer](https://css-tricks.com/what-makes-a-good-front-end-developer/) on CSS tricks is a list of interesting people describing what a frontend developer is. What skills do you think a good frontender should have and what kind of frontender are you actually? Also read Chris Coyer's [The great divide](https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/) to answer this question. -->

A divide is evolving i n the world of front-end development. There are different types of developers, which can easily be divided into two groups. On the one hand are the 'Technical Developers', who only like to get started with building cool things in JavaScript. On the other side are the more 'Creative Developers', who tackle a project to create a bold design with HTML, CSS & JavaScript, want to work out the interaction well or build an accessible application.

When a vacancy is available as a Front-end Developer, it is often questionable what type of company it is. When a position is available in a corporate company structure, a technical developer is often asked, while various design agencies have the more creative developers.

### **Which skills does a good front-end developer needs?**

In my view, a good developer should not only have knowledge of code. Of course there are many self-taught developers who have excellent knowledge in the field of technology. However, it often happens that these developers fall short in terms of structure, working in a team, strong communication skills, etc.

Where in the past the skills of HTML & CSS and a little JavaScript were enough skills as a front-end developer, today it is different. Now aspects such as bundles, git, JavaScript frameworks, testing with Cypress/JEST, docker, etc. are indispensable in the field.

### **What kind of a frontender am I?**

In the past year and a half I have developed myself enormously in the field of front-end development. Partly thanks to the courses from the minor, I was able to develop myself well as a developer. Looking at my own skillset, I think I could be a good match between a technical and a creative developer.

For example, I really enjoy working out the complex UX flow in code, to approach the best user experience, as well as working out a nice design that I receive from the user interface designer.

I fulfilled my 1st internship period within a corporate company structure, in which I performed work for 1 company in the field of front-end developer, which more closely resembles the direction as 'Technical Developer'. In my 2nd internship period I will start working at a Digital Design Agency, where I will work for various clients. Here I hope to learn more aspects of a 'Creative Developer', in order to make a final choice which direction suits me better, and what I want to work with at the beginning of my career.

# **'Inclusiveness' inside the tech-company world**

### **Do you recognize this problem in yourself?**

Diversity in the workplace is of great importance, not only in the tech world, but in the entire labor market. Sexuality, gender and ethnicity may not be prejudiced in any way.

From my own background, with a Surinamese mother and a Dutch father, I don't experience any disadvantages here. I work at Decathlon Netherlands, not so much a _tech giant_, but the company has grown considerably in the field of technology. In my current work environment, we also work with a diverse team. origin, gender, sexual preference does not matter.

### **Does inclusiveness exist in the work environment?**

I myself do not experience the disadvantages of this. However, I can well imagine that someone can experience disadvantages from this.

However, I think that within the development world there is not much going on, but this is mainly a problem at the management level. When you apply for a position as a front-end developer, we mainly look at what the skills of this person are.

I believe this should be standard in every work layer within a company. And not just who works there, but also per degree of the employment contract. A female employee, who possesses the same skills as others, earn the same salary. This is a problem that is still very common.

### **Should it change?**

There is a short answer for this, which is **yes**. A diverse work environment is good for everyone. Because the team is diverse, there is often a good working atmosphere, which is an advantage for everyone.

# **What did I learned from a shit-load of courses from the Minor Web Design & Development?**

The past five months have literally flown by. In short periods of only 4 weeks per subject, I gained a lot of knowledge and experience during the minor Web Design & Development. From a bit of messing around with CSS, to a complex application that can be used offline on a device. During the last few months I have been able to broaden my knowledge enormously. Thanks to the courses that were offered, I was able to take a big step to start my internship period as a front-end developer.

### **Web App From Scratch**

Building a well-functioning application doesn't always require a server, framework or library. Vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript can handle a lot for most users on the internet. It remains one of the easiest ways to develop a comprehensive application. Using a compiler turned out to be the perfect solution for my application.

During the project I set up a clear structure for myself. For example, using a compiler turned out to be an excellent solution for my application. The code is transformed into a smaller file, so that the performance of the project is optimal. Also, writing functional, reusable functions is something I was able to apply well during this project. As a result, I do not repeat myself, I write less code, and my application is faster again. I used all these experiments when designing a menu card with a glitchy feel.

### **CSS To The Rescue**

CSS has made good progress in recent years and is increasingly becoming a programming language. It has now grown to such an extent that it has become a specialty within the front-end world.

In four weeks we experimented with new techniques. Different contexts are discussed here, such as working with a dark & light mode, anti-animation option, user interaction using input fields. Based on these different contexts and different requirements, I challenged myself. For example, making it responsive without the media queries & level AAA of the WCAG standards.

### **Progressive Web Apps**

A progressive web app, or PWA, are built on a web platform. Think of HTML, CSS and Javascript. These applications work almost the same as a native application, which you can find in the Apple or Play store.

The idea of a progressive web application is to install it on the phone. This ensures that the web application feels like a real app.

For the course I converted my project from Web App From Scratch into a PWA. Using caching, among other things, the search history was saved, there was the option to install it on the phone, and also an offline functionality.

### **Browser Technologies**

Progressive Enhancement is an design principle that has the intention to providing the baseline of an application. Simply said, you're website should work on every device, even on a Kindle. The app is only based on your HTML code, and provides the core of your product/service.

For the assessment I developed an application that meets all the principles of Progressive Enhancement. It must be ensured that the users, on all browsers, and in every possible context can use the interactive application. The most enhanced version is 'pleasurable', so that it is good and pleasant for the user to use.

My chosen case involved developing an order system for a t-shirt. The user should be able to order a shirt with any available technology (html, css, js). The more technology available, the better the user experience.

### **Real Time Web**

The Real Time Web course focused on developing a real-time application. This means that a signal is created between multiple users, in which they have the same data at their disposal.

For this application I have chosen to develop a video calling platform with the technology of SocketIO and PeerJS. This creates several connections between the different users. It is also possible to invite a user based on a specific room code, who can then enter the room to have a conversation with you.

It was also a requirement to integrate an API on the server. To keep it appropriate, I chose to integrate a cat facts API. When a user sends a specific word, a cat fact is loaded.

### **Human Centered Design**

Human Centered Design is a problem solving approach with a focus on understanding the perspective of the person experiencing a problem. During these 4 weeks of using HCD, I put together a design for a user diagnosed with macular degeneration.

The user I was developing a tool for was really struggling with my screen reader during these four weeks. This gave me an interesting insight to develop a good solution for this. In combination with his hobby, which is running, I have developed a running schedule which is presented on the basis of sound.

What I learned during these four weeks is that it is extremely important to know who you are designing for. No design is perfect for everyone, so by clearly defining the target audience, you can develop an application that perfectly matches the need.

### **Meesterproef**

During the _Meesterproef_ it is all about applying everything learned from the previous courses within 5 weeks. We work with a real assignment which is facilitated by a real client. The importance of this course is to implement all the knowledge I have learned in the past 6 courses into a solution to a problem.

Together with two other fellow students, I built a check-in tool for car reservations for my client (Q42). We mainly looked at a logical UX, and implemented it well within the application.

During the project, we held a progress meeting with the client and customer several times. The design has also been tested several times on the target group, who occasionally rent a car.
